Problem Statement
Create a sample infrastructure in the cloud of your choice using a hello world containerized service.
Once the infrastructure is set up, your team wants to ensure that the application's performance
is monitored, and appropriate alerts are configured for any anomalies.
● Set up monitoring tools of your choice (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to collect and
visualize key performance metrics for the web application.
● Configure alerts for critical metrics (high CPU usage, high memory usage, latency spike,
application health check status).
● Create a simple incident response plan for handling alerts.
